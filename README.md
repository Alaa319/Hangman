Rules:

(1) The * characters will show you the number of letters that are in the word.

(2) You have to guess the letters of the mystery word.

(3) Once you guess a correct letter, the * will be removed and reveal the letters' place in the word.

(4) You are only allowed 6 strikes, once those 6 strikes are up you lose.

- On each round you will be told how many strikes you've used, and the letters that you have guessed.

- After the end of each round you will be asked if you would like to start another round or stop.
